## Notebook Based on Julia

_Julia is a high-level dynamic programming language designed to address the requirements of high-performance numerical and scientific computing while also being effective for general-purpose programming, web use or as a specification language._[1]

In other words, **Julia** has the best of both worlds: 
+ speeds up program development like **Python**
+ speeds up execution time like **C++**
